## Volumes

- To basic primitive of volumes is to abstract storage from k8s pods.
- Without volumes data will be lost if a pod is removed from cluster.
- Volumes exist on the cluster on their own, mostly provided by the cloud provider.
- If a pod wants to use volume, it needs to create a claim(pvc) and mount it.
- Volumes can be shared between multiple pods.
- Volumes have different acronyms like LUNs, devices, shares, mounts, spaces etc based on the underlying platform.
- Fundamental storage requirements include speed, replication, resiliency etc.
- Kubernetes provides all the fundamental storage requirement but leaves most of them to the cloud storage provider like ebs, s3 etc. 
- Kubernetes provides the interface for the pods to consume these cloud services.
  - This interface is called Cloud storage Interface(CSI).
  - This interface is implemented by cloud storage providers.
  - On the k8s side, CSI leverages kubernetes api objects for easy consumption.
- K8S storage majorly consists of 3 objects.
  - Persistent Volume(PV)
    - Its a storage resource like a 20GB SSD
  - Persistent Volume Claim(PV)
    - It is like an applications unique identifier to use PV.
  - Storage Class(SC)
    - To implement PV and PVCs dynamically.
